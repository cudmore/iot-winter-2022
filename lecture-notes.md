## Day 1

Take an online survey
    A) Classify the following as internet-of-things or not
        0) A toaster you can turn on remotely with your phone
        1) A internet web-cam pointed at an office coffee pot
        2) The satallite GPS system allowing a cell phone to know its location.
        3) Social media platforms like Twitter, FB, IG, Reddit, etc.
        4) Google maps aggregating traffic data and changing your route option.
        5) An internet web-cam that senses motion and sends you a message when someone is at your front door.
        6) An internet connected themostat that senses if your phone is on local wifi and will turn on the air-conditioning if the ambient temperature is above a certain value.
        7)
        8)
        9)
        10)

    B) Quickly type five words you think of when you think of the internet of things
        Show word cloud results of survey

Go over the 10 things that were classified and talk about them.

For the coffee pot (first example for me), it is a "thing" that transmits information on the internet. Users then look at the video and decide to get a cup of coffee or not, based on how full the pot is and if they want to bother making a new pot.


We will take this survey again at the end of the class to see how your ideas change (or not)

I take a broad definition of what is an IOT or not. I see it as a spectrum from definately not to definately yes.

### Origin of the IOT phrase

We have IOT as a phrase. What was the first use of the IOT phrase? What were the first examples of IOT? Would they be considered IOT by todays standards of IOT?

see: https://www.postscapes.com/iot-history/

1990: Considered the first IoT device, John Romkey created a toaster that could be turned on and off over the Internet for the October '89 INTEROP conference

1991: Tim Berners-Lee creates first website

1993: Created by Quentin Stafford-Fraser and Paul Jardetzky the Trojan Room Coffee Pot was located in the 'Trojan Room' within the Computer Laboratory of the University of Cambridge and was used to monitor the pot levels with an image being updated about 3x a minute and sent to the buildings server. It was later put online for viewing once browsers could display images. (via @snim2)

1998: Mark Weiser constructed a water fountain outside his office whose flow and height mimicked the volume and price trends of the stock market.

"Ubiquitous computing is roughly the opposite of virtual reality," Weiser wrote "Where virtual reality puts people inside a computer-generated world, ubiquitous computing forces the computer to live out here in the world with people."

1999 - A big year for the IoT and MIT

The Internet of Things term is coined by Kevin Ashton executive director of the Auto-ID Center:

"I could be wrong, but I'm fairly sure the phrase "Internet of Things" started life as the title of a presentation I made at Procter & Gamble (P&G) in 1999. Linking the new idea of RFID in P&G's supply chain to the then-red-hot topic of the Internet was more than just a good way to get executive attention. It summed up an important insight which is stil often misunderstood." - Full article

1999 - Neil Gershenfeld was speaking about similar things from the MIT Media Lab in his book When Things Start to Think and when establishing the Center for Bits and Atoms in 2001

"a glimpse at the brave new post-computerized world, where microchips work for us instead of against us ... We waste the potential of the microchip when we confine it to a box on our desk: the real electronic revolution will come when computers have all but disappeared into the walls around us"

This has also been expressed by many Computer Scientists when they talk about "ubiquitous computing".

## Pieces that make an IOT

What are some of the pieces that make the IOT-ness?

    - A sensor
    - A sensor that transmit it data to a central but local computer
    - A sensor that transmits data to a central computer on the internet
    - A device the uses a local sensor to triggger an acruator

Sensors. Measure thing in the world
    - Button or mouse press
    
Actuators. Take action on the world
    - A motor
    - A light that can be on/off
    - A light that can be one of many colors (RGB)


## Day 2

We will go over some IOT examples and compare and contrast their different pieces

- Pipelines
- Agriculture
- Manufacturing
- Supply chains
- Home automation (use examples to introduce MQTT)
- Smart cities
- Biometric data

Oil pipelines. They span many hundreds of miles and their reliability needs to be remotely monitored. Because failure can lead to catastrophic environmental and economic catastrophies.

Agriculture. Optimizing a farm with water, nutrients, pest control and output is critical to the livelihood of a farmer. Has broader economic impact for the cost of food. As our population grows, we need more efficient farming to feed a growing population.

Agriculture IOT is actively developed and evolving. Main bottleneck are maintaining a sensor network, how to transmit data of long distances, how to react to observations in the data. Sensor network are now being replaced by automated drones.

Manufacturing.

Supply chains.

Home automation.

Smart Cities. Although not fully realized, there is alot of interest, speculation, and also hype.
    - Tracking people for urban planning
    - Tracking traffic as done by Google MAps
    - Law enforcement with video surveylance
    - Law enforcement with "Shot Detectors"

biometric data.

## Day 3

What technologies have allowed the IOT (in all its forms) to come about?

 - increases in computing power
 - cheap and diverse sensors
 - simple to create networks
 - cloud storage and analysis

### What about personal information topics. Go over assigned reading.

Biometric Data. This is emerging as a potentially large impact IOT.
    - Tracking peoples temperature to predict pandemic outbreaks
    - Proximity tracking to track when you got close to someone with Covid
    - Large scale health studies for early disease onset detection.

The IOT can provide new and novel data, never before seen. It can also collect data on a large scale, resulting  in novel predictions that were never before hypothesized.

## Day 4

Technical details on microcontrolllers and sensors

Build an example arduino system with a LED, potentiometer, light sensor, and speaker


## Day 5

 - xxx

# Topics to cover
    - Definition of what is an IOT
    - Sensor technology
        Binary or two states
        - On/off switch
        - On/off light
        - On/off button
        Analog or continuous
        -Temperature/humidity

## Day xxx. Industry
    Industrial IOT applications are possibly the largest use case. By industrial, I mean:
        - Manufacturing
        - Process control
        - Shipping such as freight companies as well as package delivery

## Day xxx. Agriculture

    Agricultural IOT is a critical endeavor. It is needed because we need to optimize our food production to ensure a healthy world population.

## Day xxx. Smart cities

    There is alot of speculation on this from science-fiction like networks to fear of tracking citizens.

    Some realistic examples:
        - Ride share
        - Bike/scooter share
        - Parking
        - Driving

## Day xxx. Biometric data

    This has incredible potential because if done right will provide datasets never before seen. This has potential for personal data issues.

    Example of smart thermometer

    Example of health care like
        - Pacemakers that communicate to phone with blue tooth
        - Monitoring patients like with diabetes
        - Predicting pre-onset to full diabetes with activity tracking. (i) monitor glucode, (ii) monitor activity and sleep cycles
        - Intereting results with predicting epileptic seizures

## Day xxx. IOT speculation and success rates

    Another type of IOT fail is failure of a designed system to actually be used. This is mostly due to the speculation that just because it is IOT then it will be well received

    - Look up stats on IOT project failure from CISCO and IBM

## Day xxx. Network security and personal information

    A critical component is network security and personal information. The initial IOT devices were not designed with network security in mind. This has resulted in some case examples of IOT failure:

    1. 10,000 refrigerators hijacted to send spam email
    2. 


## Day xxx. Network protocols

  - How to we get sensor data to a server?
  
  - wireless technologies

  Wireless technologies can be broken up into two main classes: short range and long range.

  - Short Range
    - Wifi
    - Bluetooth
  
  - Long Range
    - Cellular (requires cell tower infrastructure.
    - LoRaWan (miles). Inrastructure can be built.

Network Communication Technology. The core of the web is the universal resource locator (url) and the hyper-text-transfer-protocol (http).

These were originally conceived by Tim Berners-Lee.

Other communication standards we use are: NTSC, USB, Ethernet, Wifi b/g/h/ac, wall power (different in different contries), AC power grid (US 120V at 60 Hz, xxx elsewhere)

MQTT. A core transmission protocol for the IOT
    - designed by oil pipeline companies
    - transmit small amout of data (rarely video streaming)
        {
            date: Monday Dec 26, 2021,
            time: 12:32.5 pm,
            sensor name: myLightSensor-1
            sensor id: xxxyyyxxx
            sensor value: 12
            sensor units: LUM
        }
    - uses a publisher/subscriber system. Sensors publish their data to the network without every having to know who will read/subsribe to it. Central computer or even other sensors can subsribe to these data streams and take action.

    - Example. Your home router publishes if you are on or off the local wifi. Your lights subscribe to this information and turn on when you in range and turn off when you are out of range.
    - You don't want the lights coming on during the day? You lights also subscribe to a time of day published by your local wifi (connected to the internet) and decide to turn on if it is past, say, 6pm.
    - Your wifi router can also publish if the sun has risen or set using it time.
    - Your lights can turn on of you arrive on the wifi and it is after sunset.

## Day xxx. Cloud processing

  - Data sent to the cloud can be processed and optionally information can be sent back to things
